This project is made with Visual Studio Code, Chrome/Firefox, Git and GitHub on a Linux Ubuntu OS.
Thanks to all of the people which made that or working there.

# === Thanks to all of you guys ===

Without the professional work of those mentioned here, but also all the others in the open source community
it would not be possible or extremely difficult for people like me to achieve my dreams. Please keep your spirit and your mindset: A big thank you to everyone who feels addressed now!

A few words to the readers of the Javascript / CSS Files: 
The code is - as you can see - sufficiently commented and structured. For some programmers this might seem strange, but for me and my way of coding it is extremely helpful. I like to use whitespace for formatting, i also describe the individual processes with comments in as much detail as it is useful for me so that I can get back to work reliably and quickly after a while. his makes working on projects for me a lot easier.

If you have any comments, suggestions for improvement or criticism of the project, please contact me! 

You find my actual contact here: https://github.com/StefanBartl/StefanBartl_Portfolio

I am very excited about it!

# = HTML, CSS & Javascript - what wonderful, tricky languages. =

Also a big and heartfelt thank you to all my friends and family for the support you always give me. 

=== Feel embraced! ===
